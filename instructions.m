    % the function stores the long instruction string in a variable
    instr = ' \n Thank you for using our script!  In order for the solver to run properly, there a few things you must first know: \n -The leftmost anchor point is point A \n -The right anchor point is point D  \n -Bar one connects point B to A  \n -Bar three connects point C to D \n -Bar two connects points B and C \n -Points A and D are stationary \n -Theta One must have a constant angular velocity \n -The vertical distance between bases is calculated by height(D) - height(A) \n -Theta one is formed between AB and the normal at point A \n -Theta two is formed between BC and the normal at point B \n -Theta three is formed between DC and the normal at point D \n\n';
